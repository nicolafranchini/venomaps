== Description ==

Tired of complex Google Maps API keys, fees, and tracking cookies? VenoMaps is the lightweight, privacy-focused solution for displaying beautiful, responsive maps on your WordPress website.

Based on OpenLayers and OpenStreetMap (OSM) data, VenoMaps ensures quick setup and full compliance with modern privacy standards, as the default map styles require **NO API KEY** and are free from tracking.

### Key Advantages (The VenoMaps Difference)

*   🔑 **NO API KEY REQUIRED:** Use the default OpenStreetMap styles completely free and without registration.
*   🍪 **Privacy-First:** The default maps are loaded without any tracking cookies, making GDPR compliance easier.
*   ⚡ **Performance-Focused:** A lightweight library ensures fast loading times compared to heavy Google Maps scripts.
*   🎨 **Fully Customizable:** Upload your custom markers and choose from multiple map styles, or add your own custom tilesets.

### Features

*   **Gutenberg Block** for easy insertion into posts and pages.
*   Manage **custom markers** using the WP Media Library.
*   **Responsive design** ensures a perfect display on all devices.
*   Advanced **Marker Clustering** for better performance with large data sets.
*   Import large lists of markers efficiently via **CSV file**.
*   **Geolocation utility** to find Latitude/Longitude from an address.
*   Supports external custom styles from Stadiamaps, Thunderforest, and Maptiler (API keys required only for these optional services).

== Installation ==

1.  Upload the plugin folder `venomaps` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2.  Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3.  Go to VenoMaps > Add New, give your map a title, and define basic options and markers.
4.  Insert the map using the VenoMaps Gutenberg Block or the shortcode `[venomap id="xxx"]`.
5.  (Optional) Add new custom map styles under Settings > VenoMaps.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

** Does this plugin support Google Maps? **

No. VenoMaps was built specifically as a robust, lightweight, and privacy-friendly alternative to Google Maps, relying on OpenStreetMap and OpenLayers for core functionality.

** Do I need an API key to use VenoMaps? **

**No.** The default map styles are loaded without the need for any API key, registration, or cost. If you wish to use premium or custom map styles from third-party services like Maptiler or Stadia Maps, you will need to obtain a key from those services.

** Can I use it to create a Store Locator? **

**Yes, absolutely.** With features like CSV import for multiple locations, marker clustering, and a search field, VenoMaps is a perfect tool for building a "Store Locator" map or any map with multiple points of interest.

** How do I place a map inside my template file? **

To display a map outside the post editor or widgets, use the following PHP code inside your template file:
`echo do_shortcode('[venomap id="xxx" height="xxx"]');`
Replace the shortcode parameters with the ones generated by the plugin on the map's edit page.
